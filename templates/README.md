# Docker development setup

1) Install Docker.app 

2) gem install stack_car

3) We recommend committing .env to your repo with good defaults. .env.development, .env.production etc can be used for local overrides and should not be in the repo.

4) sc up

``` bash
gem install stack_car
sc up

```

# Deploy a new release

``` bash
sc release {staging | production} # creates and pushes the correct tags
sc deploy {staging | production} # deployes those tags to the server
```

Releaese and Deployment are handled by the gitlab ci by default. See ops/deploy-app to deploy from locally, but note all Rancher install pull the currently tagged registry image
